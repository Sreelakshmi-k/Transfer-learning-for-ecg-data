# Transfer-learning-for-ecg-data
Using the ecg data for Arrhythmia and creating a model to identify 5 different classes of disease and use this  pretrained model to identify  Myocardial disease

A basic neural network model is created using Arrhythmia dataset which has 5 classes and the model is trained. The pretrained model is used to identify Myocardial disease. This is possible because both these diseases are diagnosed from ecg.
